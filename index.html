      <p>My Portfolio</p>
      <P>Abdullahi Ali</P>
      <p>Technology is something I am of course very passionate about as I plan to have a career in fields that actively push it forward and hope to play a small role in its future. 
        The tech that I am most invested in currently is game development and that is thanks to Unreal Engine 5. The things people have made in Unreal are unreal from the insane detail in every little thing to lighting that makes scenes that surpass the beauty of the real world.
        How people that have made something in Unreal always sound so proud of what they have accomplished.I would love to get into game development and be proud of what I created. 
        It is not just unreal but the future of game development that excites me and Unreal Engine is right now standing at the front of all of it.
